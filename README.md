# JavaScript/TypeScript Neuro Game SDK/API

This repository contains JavaScript/TypeScript implementations of the Neuro Game API, both client-side and server-side, to facilitate building integrations for [Neuro-sama](https://twitch.tv/vedal987), the AI Twitch streamer.

Both sides of the API are based on the [current official implementation of the Neuro API](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-sdk/blob/main/API/SPECIFICATION.md) by Vedal & co.

## Installation & Usage

Both sides have different usages. Refer to the respective SDK/API README file.
